## 📱 Overview

**Smart Bus Mobility** is a Flutter-based public transport solution aimed at improving the efficiency, transparency, and reliability of city bus systems. The app offers **real-time GPS tracking**, **mobile money & card payments**, and **optimized route planning** using intelligent algorithms.

It features three core platforms:

- ✅ **User Mobile App** – Passengers can track buses, plan journeys, purchase tickets, and manage profiles.
- 🚍 **Driver App Module** – Bus drivers get assigned routes, navigate optimized paths, and report status in real-time.
- 🛠️ **Admin Web Dashboard** – Transport authorities manage buses, drivers, routes, and analyze system performance with integrated route optimization (TSP).
